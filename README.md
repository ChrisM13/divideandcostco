# Divide And Costco

    Divide and Costco is an app designed to allow Costco members to take advantage of the great savings at Costco, but only purchase reasonable quantities of those items. 

    Our app is designed for people who may not be able to eat 24 avocados in a week or may not have a place to store 32 rolls of paper towels. 

    While allowing for user to take advantage of great prices, Divide and Costco also allows users to reduce their ecological footprint. Reducing the risk of unnecessary waste often created by bulk purchases.
